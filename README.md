# Vulnerability Remediation Scripts – Testing & Deployment

**Hi Team,**

Following our initial vulnerability assessment, we’ve prepared a set of remediation scripts designed to address key findings. These scripts can be integrated into your deployment tools (e.g., SCCM) and should be **tested in a staging environment** before being rolled out to production.

1. [**Third-Party Software Removal – Wireshark**](https://github.com/ayubhali/MISC/blob/main/vul-remediations/remediation-wireshark-uninstall.ps1)  
2. [**Windows OS Secure Configuration – Insecure Protocols**](https://github.com/ayubhali/MISC/blob/main/vul-remediations/toggle-protocols.ps1)  
3. [**Windows OS Secure Configuration – Insecure Ciphersuites**](https://github.com/ayubhali/MISC/blob/main/vul-remediations/toggle-cipher-suites.ps1)  
4. [**Windows OS Secure Configuration – Guest Account Group Membership**](https://github.com/ayubhali/MISC/blob/main/vul-remediations/toggle-guest-local-administrators.ps1)  

Let me know if you have any questions or would like modifications to these scripts.

Best regards,
