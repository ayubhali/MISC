# Vulnerability Remediation Scripts – Testing & Deployment

**Hi Team,**

Following our initial vulnerability assessment, we’ve prepared a set of remediation scripts designed to address key findings. These scripts can be integrated into your deployment tools (e.g., SCCM) and should be **tested in a staging environment** before being rolled out to production.
